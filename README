NAME
    Subfeedr - Open PubSubHubbub Hub that does polling and proxy PuSH pings

SYNOPSIS
      > redis-server &
      > subfeedr

DESCRIPTION
    Subfeedr is an open PubSubHubbub hub implementation that also does
    periodically polling feeds so anyone can subscribe to any feeds that are
    not PubSubHubbub publishers.

    Subfeedr is written in Perl and built on top of Tatsumaki, Plack,
    AnyEvent and Redis data store. Polling, serving web requests and
    querying database are all done in a non-blocking event loop.

NOTE
    The name Subfeedr is given with my respect to Superfeedr. This
    implementation should be considered naive, and not production ready nor
    scalable. It must be fun to hack on though!
